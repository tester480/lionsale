# Full cycle agency "LionSale"

I created [LionSale](https://dimariabovol.github.io/testing.github.io/) site as a testing task for some company.
This project I started from MobileFirst approach. 
The desktop version needed to create as a gorizontal site. This solution I realized by means of [jInvertScroll](https://github.com/pixxelfactory/jInvertScroll) plugin.
For background images in some sections I created parallax effect.
I use [Particles.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) plugin for making beautiful animation on background hero page and other.
